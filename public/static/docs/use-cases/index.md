# Use Cases

We provide short articles on common ML workflow or data management scenarios
that DVC can help with or improve. These include a justified context (usually
extracted from real-life cases), and the approaches to solving them combine
several features and commands of DVC, as well as other appropriate tools. They
range from basic to more advanced:

- [Data Versioning](/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-model-files) describes
  our most primary use: tracking and versioning large files with Git + DVC.
- [Sharing Data and Model Files](/doc/use-cases/sharing-data-and-model-files)
  goes over the basic collaboration possibilities enabled by DVC.
- [Shared Development Server](/doc/use-cases/shared-development-server) provides
  instructions to setup a single development machine for teams that prefer so.
- [Data Registries](/doc/use-cases/data-registries) explains how to use a
  <abbr>DVC repository<abbr> as a shared hub for reusing datasets or models
  among several projects.

> This list of use cases is **not** exhaustive. We keep reviewing our docs and
> will include interesting scenarios that surface in the community. Please,
> [contact us](/support) if you need help or have suggestions!

Use cases are not written to be run end-to-end. For more general, hands-on
experience with DVC, we recommend following the [Get Started](/doc/get-started),
and/or [Tutorials](/doc/tutorials) first. These include prepared datasets,
source code files, and example commands that can be copied and pasted into
terminal. These use cases also link to our more general
[User Guide](/doc/user-guide), and technical
[command references](/doc/command-reference).
